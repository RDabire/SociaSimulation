# SocialSimulation
Data Structure and Algorithm Project that looked into constructing the backbone of a social network

# What I learnt 
- Object Orientation programming
- Data structures such as linked lists and graphs
- Algorithms such as heapsort 
- Serialization

GraphsV5.py - Main program containing all classes and methods used in running the interactive and simulation mode of program

Heaps.py - Python program imported into GraphsV5 for heap sort algorithm

LinkedList.py - Python program imported into GraphsV5 for Linked list data structure 

SocialSim.py - The interactive mode of the program. Imports from GraphsV5.py all classes and methods. To run the interactive mode user should input on the command line: python3 SocialSim.py -i

UML - UML class diagram used in planning the program
